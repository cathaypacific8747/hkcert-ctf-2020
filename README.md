# HKCERT CTF 2020
This repository contains some resources we used during the CTF competition. Because of the limited time, we did not have time to properly organise our files - sorry for the messiness (time goes by really quickly!).

The main aim of this repository is for storage purposes. You can take a look at different files to grasp a general outlook of how hard the CTF might be - you can read our final [writeup](writeup.pdf) of the challenge.

Generally, programming experience will be very helpful in the competition - most challenges will require you to analyse code (Python/Java/C), decompile and reverse engineer programs (EXEs) with Ghidra, network packets (pcap) with Wireshark, and overall write some code to get the flag. The entire process was an emotional rollercoaster, but it was super fun :)

We won the Silver Award, thanks to our leader Walter who carried us during the entire competition.
